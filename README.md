# 🧠 EEG CNN Classification

**EEG‑CNN** is a project that applies a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for classification of EEG (electroencephalography) signals. This repository includes the code, model outputs, sample visualizations, and training history files used in the project.

## 📌 Project Overview

EEG signals represent electrical activity in the brain captured over time. Using deep learning techniques like CNNs, we can extract meaningful spatial and temporal features directly from processed EEG data for classification tasks such as mental state decoding and brain‑computer interfaces (BCIs).

This project focuses on training a CNN model on EEG signal data and evaluating its performance through training history and visual inspection.
